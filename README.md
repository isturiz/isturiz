# Hello, I write code and fix things.

Experience
---

I make things with [Odoo](https://github.com/odoo/odoo) and try not to break anything. If something works, (I cry) and I keep it.

Now, seriously, details matter.

Hobbies
---

- I enjoy breaking things in my [environment](https://github.com/isturiz/config) and trying CLI tools.
- I use Neovim to be an objectively superior programmer.
- I just use macOS because the battery is fine.
